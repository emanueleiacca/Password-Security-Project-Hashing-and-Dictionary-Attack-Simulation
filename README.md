# Password-Security-Project-Hashing-and-Dictionary-Attack-Simulation
# Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of password security techniques in Python, including password hashing with salts and a simulation of dictionary attacks on hashed passwords. It's designed as an educational tool to understand the basics of password hashing and the effectiveness of dictionary attacks in breaching password security.

## Features
- `imposta_password.py`: A script that simulates the process of creating a hashed password with a salt. It takes a username and password and stores them in a hashed format in `passwords.txt`.
- `attacco_dizionario.py`: A script that simulates a dictionary attack on the hashed passwords stored in `passwords.txt`, using a wordlist provided in `dizionario.txt`.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

'''bash
[git clone ](https://github.com/emanueleiacca/Password-Security-Project-Hashing-and-Dictionary-Attack-Simulation.git)
'''

## Usage
1. Run `imposta_password.py` to generate hashed passwords:
   
'''bash
python imposta_password.py
'''

3. Run `attacco_dizionario.py` to attempt a dictionary attack on the hashed passwords:
   
'''bash
python attacco_dizionario.py
'''

## Dictionary
 dictionary.txt was created using Crunch, a wordlist generator based on specific patterns (the file was generated by a user on the web, in case we wanted to create a custom set it can generate all the possible combinations of a provided character set, both it numbers, letters or symbols, within a specified minimum and maximum length)
